  - Hi junior! The situation is getting worse, we need to get to Earth as fast as
    possible.
  - Before we go I'll teach you the basic of Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), one
    of the foundation of our power.
  - OOP is a programming technique that organizes code and data into reusable structures
    called objects. Basically, we will program an object given behavior and property.
  - There is a concept called Classes in OOP. Classes define the properties (variable)
    and behaviors (methods) of objects. A class acts as a blueprint or template for
    creating objects with predefined variables and methods.
  - I talked too much. Let's dive into practical test. Behind me there's a manual
    to make a burger. Follow it, after finish, drag and drop burger on me to show
    that you're ready to go to Earth. GOOD LUCK!
