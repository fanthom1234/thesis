  Speeches:
  - Listen junior! We have a situation, the evil organization "JoJo" just invade
    planet Earth recently! And we need to help them!
  - Since concept of variable and method is foundation of our power, you must master
    it. I'll use this table plant as an example. Let's get started!
  - Variable is like a container, a way to store information or values that can change.
    For this plant we can change it size and color, so it's varaible is size and
    color.
  - A method is like a special tool that can do a specific task for you. In programming,
    a method is a set of instructions that can perform a specific task. In this table
    plant it's method can be "grow". When method run, the plant will get bigger.
  - Now try click on this plant. Try click on the method "grow" to see what it does.
    You'll see that on variables side, there is a variable that can be change and
    a private one. We make variable private so other people don't change easily,
    because it can be dangerous. But you can change "color" normally. Please change
    the pot color to "green" and increase its size.
  - After finish go to commander, he'll your mentor. You'll see in the next tutorial
    with commander that we can create any object possible. GOOD LUCK!
